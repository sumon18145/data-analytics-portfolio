# Dengue Outbreak Prediction

## 🧪 Project Overview
This project aims to predict dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh using environmental, vector, and health system data. The goal is to identify how climate (e.g., rainfall, temperature), mosquito population, and healthcare data relate to dengue incidence.

## 📊 Data & Methodology
- **Data**: Climate data, mosquito population surveys, and dengue case records.
- **Tools**: R (data cleaning, visualization, modeling)
- **Techniques**: Time series analysis, regression models, exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify important factors that influence dengue outbreaks
- Build a predictive model using R
- Recommend public health interventions based on patterns

## 📁 Files
- `dengue-model.R` — Main analysis script
- `dengue-report.Rmd` — RMarkdown report
- `dengue-report.html` — Rendered output

## 🧠 Status
🟡 In Progress – Data cleaning and EDA complete. Modeling underway.
