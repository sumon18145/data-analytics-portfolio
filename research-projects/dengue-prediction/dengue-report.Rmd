🧪 Introduction
Dengue fever is a major public health concern in Bangladesh. This report explores how climate and health data can predict dengue outbreaks and guide public health interventions.

📊 Simulated Data

df <- data.frame(
  date = seq.Date(from = as.Date("2018-01-01"), by = "month", length.out = 72),
  cases = round(abs(rnorm(72, mean = 100, sd = 50))),
  rainfall = round(runif(72, 100, 400)),
  temperature = round(runif(72, 25, 35), 1)

✅ Conclusion
This basic analysis will be extended with real data and advanced models for better outbreak prediction.
